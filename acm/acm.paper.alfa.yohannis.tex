\section{Introduction}


The role of Information Technology (IT) strategy has become increasingly significant across various sectors, including Higher Education \cite{hashim2021higher}. In an era where digital transformation drives innovation, IT strategies are crucial for achieving institutional goals, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving the quality of services provided \cite{rahmadi2024research}. Within the context of Higher Education, these strategies are vital for ensuring that institutions remain competitive in an increasingly dynamic academic environment \cite{fernandez2023digital}.

IT strategies in Higher Education are often developed through diverse methodologies, including strategic alignment with institutional goals, benchmarking against peer institutions, and leveraging frameworks such as enterprise architecture \cite{bianchi2023it}. These approaches aim to optimise the utilisation of technology to support academic excellence, enhance research outputs, and improve student engagement \cite{digitalsystems2022strategy}.

Moreover, global ranking systems, such as those provided by \textit{Times Higher Education (THE)}, introduce variables that significantly influence universities' positions in these rankings \cite{times2023methodology}. Factors such as research output, teaching quality, industry collaboration, and international outlook play a pivotal role in determining an institutionâ€™s rank \cite{times2022rankings}. By analysing the relationships between these variables, it becomes possible to identify which aspects should be prioritised within IT strategies to maximise their impact on institutional performance.


This study aims to explore the relationships among key variables highlighted by \textit{Times Higher Education (THE)} and how these insights can inform the development of effective IT strategies tailored to the needs of Higher Education institutions. Through an analysis of the correlations between these variables, patterns and dependencies are identified, highlighting critical areas of focus for IT investments. Based on this analysis, a set of IT strategies is proposed to specifically target improvements in the variables most significant to universities' performance.

This paper is structured into several sections. The Introduction highlights the significance of IT strategy in Higher Education, while the Related Work reviews studies on deriving such strategies, focusing on methodologies and the role of \textit{Times Higher Education} rankings. The Methodology describes the analysis of these rankings' variables. The Results and Discussion present key findings, followed by IT Strategy Recommendations offering actionable insights. Finally, the Conclusion and Future Work summarise the study's contributions and suggest future research directions.


\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature_review}

The development of an Information Technology (IT) strategy is a critical process that aligns technology initiatives with organisational objectives. Various frameworks and methodologies have been proposed in the literature to aid this alignment, ensuring that IT contributes to achieving competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

\subsection{Frameworks for IT Strategy Development}

Drechsler and WeiÃŸschÃ¤del \cite{drechsler2018framework} proposed a framework tailored for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to develop IT strategies. Their approach integrates theoretical foundations with empirical validation, ensuring practical relevance for organisations with limited resources. The framework emphasises iterative processes, allowing organisations to adapt their strategies dynamically as they grow and encounter new challenges.

El Alami and Belemlih \cite{elalami2021digital} explored the integration of IT governance and management frameworks, such as COBIT, to formulate a digital strategy. Their study highlights the importance of combining existing best practices to address emerging digital transformation needs. By focusing on governance, organisations can align IT objectives with overall business strategies effectively.

De Haes and Van Grembergen \cite{dehaes2009governance} emphasised the role of IT governance frameworks in supporting IT strategy development. They discussed the use of maturity models to assess and improve IT alignment with organisational goals. Their work also highlights the importance of executive-level involvement in IT decision-making processes.

\subsection{Alignment with Organisational Objectives}

Adama et al. \cite{adama2024alignment} examined theoretical frameworks that support the alignment of IT and business strategies to achieve sustained competitive advantage. They argue that IT strategy should not only support current business operations but also anticipate future market demands and technological advancements. This forward-looking approach ensures that IT remains a strategic asset rather than a mere operational tool.

Putra et al. \cite{putra2022trends} conducted a systematic review of IT strategy implementation trends across various sectors. Their findings underscore the challenges organisations face in aligning IT strategies with broader organisational objectives. Key barriers include resource constraints, resistance to change, and the complexity of integrating legacy systems with modern technologies.


\subsection{Challenges in IT Strategy Formulation}

Rahmadi \cite{rahmadi2024research} identified digital transformation as a key driver of IT strategy development. However, he also noted that many organisations struggle to keep pace with technological advancements. His research highlights the need for adaptive strategies that can evolve with changing market conditions and technological landscapes.

FernÃ¡ndez et al. \cite{fernandez2023digital} conducted a multivocal literature review of digital transformation initiatives in higher education. They emphasised the importance of stakeholder engagement in IT strategy development, noting that successful strategies often involve collaboration between IT departments, academic staff, and administrative leaders.

\subsection{Emerging Trends and Future Directions}

The increasing complexity of IT environments has led to the adoption of more sophisticated tools and methodologies for strategy development. For instance, machine learning and predictive analytics are now being used to forecast the impact of IT investments on organisational performance. These technologies enable more informed decision-making and greater agility in responding to market changes \cite{digitalsystems2022strategy}.


\subsection{Use of Rankings and Performance Metrics}

Performance metrics\footnote{The terms `metrics' and `variables' are used interchangeably.} play a pivotal role in shaping IT strategies, particularly in higher education institutions. Rankings such as those provided by Times Higher Education (THE) emphasize variables such as research output, teaching quality, and international collaboration as critical factors influencing university competitiveness. Integrating these metrics into IT strategies enables institutions to align their technological initiatives with objectives that enhance their global standing \cite{times2023methodology}.

Da Silva and Santos \cite{dasilva2014cobit} examined IT governance frameworks and their application in strategic planning, demonstrating that metrics derived from ranking systems like THE can serve as benchmarks for prioritising IT investments. This approach ensures that IT initiatives directly contribute to improving institutional rankings and overall performance.

Further exploration of the relationship between ranking metrics and strategic planning is provided by Uslu \cite{uslu2020university}, who analysed key indicators from international university rankings, including THE. Uslu's findings reveal how metrics such as research output, teaching quality, and international collaboration can inform institutional strategies aimed at enhancing competitiveness. By understanding the weight and impact of these indicators, universities can craft IT strategies that target specific areas for improvement, directly contributing to enhanced rankings.

A complementary perspective is offered by a study on university competitiveness through data analytics \cite{analytics2022competitiveness}, which proposed predictive models to assist universities in improving their performance in rankings like THE. These models leverage historical ranking data and institutional metrics to identify areas requiring focused improvement. The study underscores the importance of IT in enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning, ensuring that technology investments are directed towards metrics with the highest potential impact.

Although the direct linkage between THE metrics and IT strategy development is not always explicit, these studies collectively provide actionable insights. Universities can harness IT to implement strategies that enhance performance in areas such as research output, teaching excellence, and global collaborationâ€”key drivers of improved ranking outcomes.

This research builds on these foundations by taking a unique approach. It examines THE metrics and variables over a longitudinal period of 10 or more years, providing a deeper understanding of their correlations and influence on institutional rankings. By identifying the most impactful variables, this study offers a framework for developing IT strategies that specifically address these critical areas. Such targeted strategies ensure that IT investments are optimally aligned with institutional objectives, maximising their impact on performance and ranking outcomes.


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The research was performed quantitatively, with data collected through web scrapping. Python scripts were written to process, analyse, and visualise the collected data using its various libraries. 

\subsection{Data Collection and Cleaning}

The data scrapping was achieved by collecting universities' ranks and rank factors by scrapping scores from 2013 to 2023 in the Times Higher Education (THE) website \cite{the2024} and combining it with the data of university ranks obtained from Kaggle \cite{ONeil_2020}\footnote{The contribution of this dataset was minimal.}, producing more than 11-year data span with 711 universities involved. 

After collecting the necessary data, it underwent several data-cleaning steps to ensure it was ready for analysis. First, empty numeric values were filled using linear estimation, logarithmic estimation, etc., based on the coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ to estimate the missing values. The filled values were then normalised and added as a new column to the dataset. Secondly, empty non-numeric values were filled with `n/a' to help handle missing non-numeric values in the following steps.

Finally, unnecessary columns were removed to streamline the dataset, and only several columns were used in the analysis as variables. These variables were overall score, rank, research score, teaching score, citations score, intl students, international outlook score, student staff ratio, industry income score, number students, year. 

\subsection{Data Analysis}

Correlations were calculated between the variables. The analysis assessed the strength of the relationships using correlation coefficients, along with their statistical significance. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient \cite{spearman1904general} was employed to ensure the robustness of the results, as it does not assume normality in the data distribution. The significance of the correlations was evaluated to determine whether the observed relationships were likely to have occurred by chance. A graph chart was used to help comprehend the data, that nodes represented the variables of THE and edges were the correlations between them.

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/correlation_graph.pdf}
	\caption{Correlation graph between the variables of Times Higher Education Rank. Correlations with }
	\label{fig:graf_citation}
\end{figure*}

\section{Results and Discussion}
This section examines the correlations among THE variables, including international outlook score, rank, citations score, overall score, industry income score, international students, research score, number of students, student-to-staff ratio, and teaching score. A summary of these correlations is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:graf_citation}. The graph highlights only significant correlations with a strength greater than 0.1. Additionally, the diameter of each node represents the variable's overall influence, calculated as the sum of its correlations with other variables.


\subsection{Analysis of Correlations with Overall Score}

The correlation analysis highlights key factors associated with the \textit{overall score}, emphasizing its role as a comprehensive measure of institutional performance (Table \ref{tab:correlation_overall}). Among the variables examined, the \textit{rank} ($r = -0.89$), \textit{research score} ($r = 0.86$), and \textit{teaching score} ($r = 0.81$) exhibit the strongest correlations. The strong negative correlation with \textit{rank} underscores the critical relationship between overall institutional performance and competitive standings. Similarly, the high positive correlations with \textit{research score} and \textit{teaching score} highlight the importance of academic and research excellence in achieving higher overall scores.

Moderate correlations are observed for \textit{citations score} ($r = 0.72$), \textit{international students} ($r = 0.39$), \textit{industry income score} ($r = 0.34$), and \textit{international outlook score} ($r = 0.32$). These findings suggest that impactful research, global engagement, and industry collaborations substantially contribute to shaping the overall score.

Weaker correlations include \textit{student-to-staff ratio} ($r = -0.24$), \textit{year} ($r = 0.19$), and \textit{number of students} ($r = 0.14$). While these variables show limited direct influence on the overall score, maintaining favorable ratios and engaging large student populations remain important for broader institutional objectives.

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsection{Analysis of Correlations with Rank}

The correlation analysis highlights key determinants influencing institutional rankings (Table \ref{tab:correlation_rank}). Among the examined variables, the \textit{overall score}, \textit{research score}, \textit{teaching score}, and \textit{citations score} exhibit the strongest negative correlations, underscoring their significant impact on rank. The \textit{overall score} ($r = -0.89$) and \textit{research score} ($r = -0.84$) emerge as the most influential factors, emphasizing their critical roles in driving institutional performance and competitiveness.

Moderate negative correlations are observed for \textit{teaching score} ($r = -0.82$), \textit{citations score} ($r = -0.70$), and \textit{international students} ($r = -0.38$), highlighting the importance of academic quality, research impact, and global engagement in shaping rankings. Weaker negative correlations are found for \textit{industry income score} ($r = -0.29$) and \textit{international outlook score} ($r = -0.27$), reflecting their secondary influence on institutional rankings.

Positive correlations are observed for \textit{student-to-staff ratio} ($r = 0.24$) and \textit{year} ($r = 0.15$), suggesting that less favorable staff ratios and newer data are weakly associated with poorer rankings. The \textit{number of students} ($r = -0.15$, $p = 0.00$) demonstrates a small but significant negative relationship, indicating limited influence on rank outcomes.

These results reinforce the centrality of performance-driven metrics, particularly those related to research and teaching quality, in shaping institutional rankings. While internationalization factors add further depth, their impact is relatively modest compared to core academic indicators.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Analysis of Correlations with Research Score}

The correlation analysis highlights critical factors contributing to the \textit{research score}, emphasizing its central role in institutional performance (Table \ref{tab:correlation_research}). Among the examined variables, the \textit{overall score} ($r = 0.86$) and \textit{teaching score} ($r = 0.86$) exhibit the strongest positive correlations, underscoring their close alignment with research activities. Enhancing both teaching and overall institutional quality directly supports improvements in research performance.

The \textit{rank} ($r = -0.84$) demonstrates a strong negative correlation, reaffirming the inverse relationship where higher research scores correspond to better rankings (lower numerical rank values). This finding underscores the pivotal role of research excellence in achieving competitive standings.

Moderate correlations are observed for \textit{industry income score} ($r = 0.45$), \textit{citations score} ($r = 0.45$), and \textit{international students} ($r = 0.31$). These results suggest that impactful research outputs, industry partnerships, and global engagement significantly influence research scores. The \textit{international outlook score} ($r = 0.22$) also reflects the contribution of internationalization, though to a lesser extent.

Weaker correlations include \textit{number of students} ($r = 0.20$), \textit{student-to-staff ratio} ($r = -0.16$), and \textit{year} ($r = 0.08$). While these metrics exhibit limited direct impact on research performance, optimizing these factors may still provide ancillary benefits to institutional quality.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis of Correlations with Teaching Score}

The correlation analysis highlights key factors contributing to the \textit{teaching score}, emphasizing its critical role in institutional performance (Table \ref{tab:correlation_teaching}). Among the examined variables, the \textit{research score} ($r = 0.86$), \textit{rank} ($r = -0.82$), and \textit{overall score} ($r = 0.81$) exhibit the strongest correlations. The positive correlations with \textit{research score} and \textit{overall score} underscore the alignment of teaching excellence with broader institutional quality and academic outputs. Conversely, the strong negative correlation with \textit{rank} highlights the inverse relationship, where higher teaching scores correspond to better rankings (lower numerical rank values).

Moderate correlations are observed for \textit{citations score} ($r = 0.43$), \textit{industry income score} ($r = 0.38$), and \textit{student-to-staff ratio} ($r = -0.34$). These findings indicate that impactful research, robust industry collaborations, and favorable staff-to-student ratios significantly influence teaching quality.

Weaker correlations include \textit{international students} ($r = 0.20$), \textit{number of students} ($r = 0.20$), \textit{international outlook score} ($r = 0.03$), and \textit{year} ($r = 0.02$). While these variables exhibit limited direct influence on teaching performance, they may contribute indirectly by shaping the broader institutional environment.
